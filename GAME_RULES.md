# Skull â€” Detailed Game Rules

## Game Components

-   Each player has a set of 4 cards:
    -   3 Rose cards (safe)
    -   1 Skull card (dangerous)

## Setup

1. Each player takes their set of 4 cards.
2. Players sit in a circle or around a virtual table.
3. The starting player is chosen randomly.

## Game Flow

The game is played in rounds, with each round consisting of two phases:

### 1. Stack Phase

-   Starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, each player must place one card face-down in front of them.
-   After everyone has placed at least one card, on your turn you may either:
    -   Place another card face-down on top of your stack (if you have cards remaining in your hand)
    -   Start the bidding phase

### 2. Bidding Phase

-   The player who chose to start bidding makes the first bid.
-   A bid is a number representing how many cards the player believes they can flip without revealing a skull.
-   Proceeding clockwise, each player must either:
    -   Make a higher bid
    -   Pass (once you pass, you cannot bid again in this round)
-   Bidding continues until all players except one have passed.

### 3. Flipping Phase

-   The highest bidder must now flip cards equal to their bid without revealing a skull.
-   The player MUST start by flipping their own cards first, one by one.
-   After flipping all of their own cards, they may choose cards from other players to flip.
-   When choosing another player's cards, they must flip from the top of that player's stack.

### 4. Resolution

-   If the player successfully flips the number of cards they bid without revealing a skull:
    -   They score one point.
    -   All cards are returned to their owners.
-   If the player reveals a skull:
    -   They lose one of their cards at random (removed from the game).
    -   All cards are returned to their owners.
    -   If the skull revealed belonged to another player, that player chooses which of the bidder's cards to remove.

## Winning the Game

-   The first player to score 2 points wins the game.
-   If a player loses all their cards, they are eliminated from the game.

## Strategic Elements

-   Bluffing is key: sometimes you want others to think you placed a skull when you didn't (or vice versa).
-   Memory is important: try to remember which players have played skulls in previous rounds.
-   Card management: losing cards reduces your options in future rounds.
-   Bidding strategy: sometimes it's better to force another player to make a high bid than to win the bid yourself.

## Digital Adaptation Notes

-   In the digital version, cards are hidden from other players automatically.
-   The app handles turn order and validates all moves.
-   Visual cues help players track the game state more easily than in the physical version.
-   Sound effects and animations enhance the tension of card flips.
